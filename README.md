===============

These are scripts for creating an Arduino driven laser writing robot.

1. First step is to upload the Arduino/laser_writer/laser_writer.ino script into an Arduino UNO.
2. Second step is to launch Processing and run the Processing/laserGraffiti/laserGraffiti.pde script.


NOTE:  Need to add documentation regarding pin connections on arduino board and setup of 2 Axis Servo
with an attached UV Laser.
